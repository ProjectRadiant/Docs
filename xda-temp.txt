[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]

Project Radiant is a custom ROM aiming to be original, we make our own features, we make our own UI. We have been around since February 2021 and have grown ever since. We support a variety of devices and try to update the ROM as frequently as we can, at the end we all are students and work on this as a hobby which can cause delays. The team is pretty small and we are always looking forward to more people joining us
